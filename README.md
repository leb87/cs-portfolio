## Reflection Responses

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating user stories help with this?**  
I interpret user needs by breaking them down into clear, specific requirements that describe what the user expects the system to do. Turning these needs into user stories helps because each story focuses on a single piece of functionality from the user’s point of view. This keeps development centered on real goals instead of assumptions. User stories also make it easier to prioritize work and confirm that each feature delivers value.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**  
I approach developing programs by dividing the work into smaller tasks and planning out what can realistically be completed within a short time frame. Agile practices like sprint planning, daily check-ins, and regular reviews help keep progress on track. I also find that reflecting at the end of each sprint helps me see what worked well and what needs improvement. I plan to use these processes in future projects because they promote steady progress and continuous improvement.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**  
Being a good team member means communicating clearly, completing work on time, and being open to feedback. It also involves supporting teammates, adapting when plans change, and keeping shared goals in mind. Good teamwork helps the entire group deliver a stronger final product and keeps the development process efficient and positive.
